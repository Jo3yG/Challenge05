# Challenge05
## Your Task(Based on README)

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;10pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;10pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
## Code
The code was already partly given to us and we just had to add extra code as well as API's in order to produce what was asked.
## Issues
There were a lot of problems i came across with this one, learning the "this" was kinda troublesome and gave me some real hard issues, also i had a couple of blunders when I was inputing the wrong classes by nameing them differently, i was able to recover from local storage after I was able to name everything correctly and use the correct names where they need to be.
## Offline
I did do a lot of this code offline so there will be limited commets when i git push and what not but i tried to add enough commets on my actual code to get the reader to understand what i was trying to accomplish and what i wanted to add, i wanted to use a different API for the date and time but though otherwise.
